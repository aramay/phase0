1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

    The Styles pane shows the CSS rules that apply to the selected element, from highest priority to lowest:
    You can add or edit styles within the Styles pane in the Elements panel. Unless the area containing the styling information is greyed out, all styles are editable. Edit styles in the following ways:
        * Edit an existing property name or value.
        * Add a new property declaration.
        * Add a new CSS rule.

2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
    We can resize elements by their.
        * width
        * height
        * padding 
        * margins

3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
    * Relative positioing moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
    * Absolute - The box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other boxes.
    * Fixed- An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    * Static - In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSSS property to indicate tht element should appear in normal flow.

4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
    
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

    I loved this challenge, there was a lot of consfusion around positioning of boxes. In solo challenges, i spent most of time on positioning my elements. 
    I liked it because we got to work with different positioning property e.g. absolute and relative. The box offset properties were difficult to understand. Through discussion and trial and error helped to place elements where the element should appear. 

    I think this challenge should be split into two seperate sessions. It took us 2 hours to get through this challenge. I felt rushed through it, i would prefer to talk more about it and try more scenarios with peer.
