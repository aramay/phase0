      <h3>Here in week one of Phase 0</h3>
      <p>in DBC our focus has been on learning to use GitHub as a Version Control System and making a habit of the commands required to use GitHub effectivley that will eventually allow us to work with teams of any size on larger projects. The Version Control System involves creating a temporary duplicate of the repository (the project at hand) that you can make and save changes to without corrupting the master version everyone else is working off. This is called checking out a branch. Once you check out a branch, you can create new material or change existing coding and structure and it won't change the master or anyone else's work untill your branch is merged with the master repo. As these updated branches are merged back to the master a giant timeline logs every change with a time stamp, all the changes, and the name of the user who made the changes. This timeline alone is a valuable tool for checking updates and progress but it also works like a time machine and a user can pull a branch from any spot on the timeline to backup or restore.

      <h3>How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?</h3>
      <p>Developer use it achieve following goals maintain different version of software revert changes easy backup more than one developer can work on project What is a commit? In version control system, a commit adds latest changes to software repository. This way when other user do any update or checkout a project, they will receive a latest version, unless they specify they wish to retrieve a previous version of the source code in the repository. What are the best practices for commit messages? A project's long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project's log. Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change is so simple that no further context is necessary. e.g “fixed typo” when a commit merits a bit of explanation and context, you need to write a body with Subject. e.g: Fixed bug#23 Expired user were is able to create certificate. As per business requirements, this is not allowed. What does the HEAD^ argument mean? HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the current checked out branch. HEAD~3, HEAD~4, HEAD~5, are the 3rd 4th and 5th commit from HEAD respectively. What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other? three stages are git add git commit -m “message” git push origin Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes. As a good practice, you should create a branch for your changes type git checkout -b create a file and add changes. save file and exit on command line type git status What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other? three stages are git add git commit -m “message” git push origin Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes.

Answer the following questions within that block comment:

- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

<section> element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.

<article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable

<nav> - represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.

  <footer> - A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

 - elements are orderd the say way they are defined in .html file. They are stacked on top of each other.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

- code snippets are useful in creating shorcuts.

Some that already exist -
