 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown",
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

terah.spouse = adam


var adam = {
  name: "Adam",
  spouse: terah
};


// var terah = {
//   name: "Terah",
//   age: 32,
//   height: 66,
//   weight: 125,
//   hairColor: "brown",
//   // eyeColor: "brown",
//   spouse: adam
// };

// console.log(adam.spouse)
console.log(terah)



// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
//answer the following questions:

// What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
//
//
