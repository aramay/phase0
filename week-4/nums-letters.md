#Release 1: Summarize

1. What does puts do?
    puts simply writes onto the screen whatever comes after it.

    `puts 3`
2. What is an integer? What is a float?
    Interger:

    Integers are a special group or category of numbers that:

    Consist of the set of numbers: 
    >{…-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…}
    Are all positive and negative whole numbers, which do not include any fractional or decimal part.

    Floats:
    A float is a number with fractional parts, so basically a decimal 
    >(e.g. 1.00, 3.21).
3.  What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

    The difference between float and integers can be described as to how we use _Many_ and _Much_

    e.g. We say, how _many_ children do you have ? becuase we can quanitfy, we don't say how _much_ children do u've ?

    Similarly, we use _much_ when we cannot quantify. 
    e.g. How _much_ water is in this glass.
