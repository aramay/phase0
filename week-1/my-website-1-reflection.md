# Release 5: Reflect

    Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file. 
1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
 * [Link](http://kasper341.github.io/)

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

    * Login to your GitHub account.
    * Next to your avatar, click “+” button and select “New Repository” option
    * Give it a name.
    * Follow default options
    * Select Add License as “MIT License” 

3. Describe what open source means.

    * open source mean that you have the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. As compared to proprietary software, you can’t view the source code. As a user you can only consume the software. They preserve the right to use, modify and distribute software.

4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

    * I think open source is a great initiative. Most of my learning came from using open source software e.g. linux (ubuntu). To understand it’s importance, i like to look at it’s history - Imagine you work on a piece of code, because you did a great job it was widely accepted among your peers. Now some corporation named “xyz” and puts it under restrictive access. All of a sudden, you no longer have access to this piece of code. You have to pay to use that software and definitely cannot make any changes. 

    How would that make you feel. Here a link to history [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) 

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.
    
>A software license is a legally binding agreement that specifies the terms of use for an application and defines the rights of the software producer and of the end-user. All software must be legally licensed before it may be installed.” 

    Type of License determines the use of software, if it can be distributed, modified and used. If it’s a commercial venture, you may want to use proprietary license. 

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
    
    * using Git and GitHub
    * I made mistake of not committing my changes and trying to push to remote repository. 
    * branching and creating a pull request is lot clear now. 
7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If     so, please list it.
