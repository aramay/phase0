- I used .is_a?(Integer) to find intergers is a array, if found, increment that value with given argument

- In hashes, i used iteration.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
